I have a patch for tex2pdf because of the new upcomming
release of lyx1.5.
I'm unsure though, if this may be the correct list.

Loud and clear.
But I have no access to the project to commit your patch :-(

Thanks for awakening this list.

I was afraid to get a report like this. :(

> Thanks for awakening this list.

Ok. But this list seems to need some coffee first.

Hello Kornel,

sorry for not responding I was no longer subscribed to the list by 
accident as I have deleted the corresponding email address because of spam.

After a wake-up-message from mariux I have now re-subscribed.

I thought tex2pdf is no longer needed as LyX or even pdftex is doing all 
the necessary stuff on its own now. And as a result the tool has zero 
users at the moment. So, I am pleased to hear that it is still in use at 
least by one person. :-)

So, you have a patch? Post it to the list or if you prefer it send it to 
me in private.

  Steffen

Count +1

Attached is a mail where I find some features of tex2pdf still useful.

Regards, and glad to hear again from you.

>>What exactly is the \lyxdot problem?

In 1.5 a LyX version of the dot has been added, so that the regular expressions
in tex2pdf which extracted the graphics file name fails.
Kornel added a small patch to make tex2pdf still work, so he wanted to commit it to the
project.

Sure, but tex2pdf handles other stuff, like managing hyperref externally, static conversion
of eps files to pdf with caching, makeindex management, etc. which may be used from inside LyX (here I have added
a pdf3 format to be able to create pdf from the View/Export menu with tex2pdf), and is not bound to
lyx : tex2pdf foo.lyx just adds lyx -e latex foo.lyx and then works an foo.tex.

>>
>>Is there a feature left that is provided by tex2pdf that is not built in 
>>LyX 1.4?

The hyperref management: take e.g. an article for a conference, build it with plain latex/dvi compilation,
once it's OK that way, a tex2pdf run provide an hypetexed version (with PDF toc) with no extra coding.

The compilation speed: with a doc with a large amount of figures, it's mure more efficient to optimize the
layout with palin latex compilation, and to shift to pdflatex just for the last one.

Semms that the tex2pdf project (which is frozen since october 23, 2003) should however cope with
the infrequent changes in LyX which make it fail, so some commits may be needed from time to time.
This one is the first one since the last release.

I suggested your name because your LyX Installer project is on berlios.de, as tex2pdf. But I see on the project
page that there is a new admin (Marius Tolzmann).

I should have checked before, sorry, Kornel should contact him to see what's possible.

Thank you for your message.

Regards

Hello!

Finally, I looked up how to use cvs again. It has been a long time ... ;-)

Kornel's patch is now uploaded to the CVS repository and I am ready to 
accept more patches if there are any.

Thanks to Kornel again for the patch!

Bye, Steffen

I have a second minor patch ...

If you are on a unix-system and want to handle a tex-file
created with a windows-lyx, so the embedded \r are very disturbing.
This patch removes them.
I also had some errors on lines starting with "\begin\{document} %"
