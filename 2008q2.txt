Hello all,

  I?m a project manager just involving in a big project(About 0.5 million users). I just using tex2pdf tool to transfer TEX file to PDF. But the performance is not accepted, especially in IBM AIX operating system.

  In windows, the performance is about 1 second on file. But in AIX(4 CPU, 8G memory), it needs 20 seconds. 

  Can anybody give me some advice about this problem. Now I face grate pressure from the customer. The customer need to process all 0.5 million files in one day. 

  Thanks.

Hello Paul Suen,

tex2pdf is only a front-end script for pdftex. I guess pdftex takes most 
of your performance. So, if you want to increase the speed you should 
look at pdftex.

You can find more information here:

Good luck.

Bye, Steffen
