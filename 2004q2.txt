Subject: [tex2pdf-friends] Using eps2eps to solve figure rotation problems
Message-ID: <200404261435.i3QEZ4p10509@cressida.cert.fr>

Hello,

I posted a mail in the old tex2pdf list about the use of
eps2eps instead of convert.

Angus Leeming (thank him) showed me that these were the same
(I thought that epswrite output of gs would
keep the vector structure of eps files, and this is a mistake 
as a simple test can show). Both IM and esps2eps use
the same gs filter.

Identification of sources of undesired eps figure rotation
between ps output and pdf output remains to be done in
order to set up efficient filters...

Message-ID: <200406131551.12215.roland-schmitz@gmx.de>

Hi tex2pdf users,

i'm a newbee with tex2pdf, but i've got two problems with tex2pdf and lyx.
1) at the end of my document there is the bibliograhpy and the index. If i 
gererate a pdf document with tex2pdf the index is missing, if i use dvipdfm 
it's ok.
2) acroread show's all chapters of my document in the bookmarklist expect one 
chapter. I can't the any difference, between this chapter an the other ones.

Mit freundlichem Gruss    Yours sincerely

  Roland Schmitz

You need to configure tex2pdf to activate makeindex, run
tex2pdf -c
to specify which index file to use, and any other makeindex option

Check the log, probably something prevents hyperref to compute the bookmark.
You will see e.g. for math that it fails, but it does half the work
(the bookmarks miss the math, simply).

It turns out here that it came from gs after all: upgrading from
7.05 to 8.14 on Solaris 2.8 made the problem disappear
on my favourite example.

Good news then, this bored me for a while.
